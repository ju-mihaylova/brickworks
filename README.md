# Brickwork

A console app that accepts input parameters for a given layout of bricks for
the first layer, determines the possible layout of a second layer, or proves that it is
impossible to create the second layer and prints it in the console.

The second layer must be created in a way that no brick in it lies exactly on a brick from the first layer. However, it is allowed half of the same brick to lie on the same brick on the second layer.
